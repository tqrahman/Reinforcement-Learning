# Reinforcement-Learning

I am very interesting in learning Reinforcement Learning. Usually I would read the textbook, understand the math, and then code 
but thought I should experiement with hands on coding. Go through some tutorials I find online and learn the math and concept as 
I go. 

Disclaimer:
The code in this Reinforcement Learning Tutorials is not my work. I am just coding along with either the video or blog that I am walkthrough.
